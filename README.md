# GS2bib
This Python code get as input the author's name and generate a .bib file from the author's Google Scholar.

In case of finding more than one author with exactly same name, the code generate a list of affliation and ask the user to choose the right affliation from the list.

The idea for this code came from my own need to include all my papers in ORCID where the user can privode a .bib file.

If there are many publications it is not handy to get the bib entries for each of the items manually.

This code will help authors in this regard.

To run the code you need to have the 'scholarly' python package.
